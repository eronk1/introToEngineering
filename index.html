            <h1 class="learned2">The moment arrived to confront my deepest fears and exhibit my rugged prowess in executing the daring marble challenge. Ethan Chang, a watchful figure in the distance, bore witness as if my failure equaled my demise. In times such as these, there existed no space for faltering, only the stark choice between life and death. However, in the end, none of it truly held significance. It wasn't the individual that met their demise, but rather the collective brotherhood that faced its reckoning together. As it turned out, we all met our fate because our performance was nothing short of abysmal. Fueled by embarrassment, disappointment, and an unparalleled rage, Ethan Chang spared us from our destiny, ensuring my survival to see another week.</h1>

            <h1 class="learned2">From the unassuming "I Forgot" website emerged a creation that opened a portal to a world where I could relive profound encounters with the enigmatic warrior, Ethan Chang. His incredible might was demonstrated through the creation of a mere light bulb, yet as its brilliance intensified, darkness shrouded everything. In the obscurity, a luminous, eerie bulb emerged, challenging me to replicate the supernatural spectacle. The task seemed insurmountable, with brilliance blinding reality, strength rendering itself feeble, intelligence verging on foolishness, challenges diminishing to insignificance, and speed agonizingly slowing. This mystical mastery belonged solely to Ethan Chang, a revelation I was privileged to witness. Week 2 end. (This design soon to be implemented bore the unmistakable imprint of the illustrious grand master, Ethan Chang, a luminary whose creative genius knew no bounds)</h1>
