            <h1 class="learned2 lineHeight">In the 21st century a man emerges from the speck of dust under the shadows in the midst of the 3rd industrial revolution. Here we discovered an ancient artificact called oobleck. This substsance beat the old craftsman and architect Newton. This is a substance not following the flow of substance therefore defying physics. Here we studied the techniques mastered by witches in the 16th century. In the witch's craft we finally learned the substance of ingenuine solid. NOTHING BUT A LIER!!?</h1>

It was by Ethan's magnanimity the project was able to be pursued into the vicious road til now. Our project composes of a moving piano. An instrument that will revolutionize music and art. The thoughts of the design is buttons are pressed so that the sound plays and through the marvelous motors the wheels will pursue its ultimate journey. What we are planning for next week is to design stuff and estimate stuff and do stuff that are varies. Although the tasks may be difficult we will venture into its extreme debts to come out stronger and faster and smarter.</h1>

            <h1 class="learned2 lineHeight">Last week we made a piano work on 1 note. However, due to circumstances I was unable to get my piano. The ultimate goal for this spectacular raining week is to poursue into the ventures with my arduino piano. Let the melodies flow. Let America be great again. I hope to complete the ability for the arduino to play two notes at once. Our car was venturing. I got wet by the tears of joy of rain. We also played some soccer but i was sick so i couldn't run that much which made me seek the freedom of the united states.</h1>

An artifact that will evolutionize our car. In the week beforehand we developed a piano surpassing our limits with Ethan brimming us with the ideas. Emma Oh the partner of the project layed out the arduino car to set us to our victory. Meanwhile in the finishing of my piano. We will aim to finish the car to be drivable. Not only that but our code should avoid as many errors as possible. The weekend was filled with football (soccer) breaking limits.</h1>

                <h1 class="learned2 lineHeight3">We performed full of anxiety and nationalism for our license plate. Our car performed fine but due to power restraints the car's speed was not optimal. With our remote control design we were able to make the car go forward forever til the battery ran out. We were unable to combine the properties of tone with a remote which was unfortunate. However, we were able to get the car moving and make it driveable.I learned the basic functions of c++. I also learned A LOT of limitations of arduino uno board. I learned how to go around the restraints set by this board. Our car can go a long distance until the battery gives up. In this journey uphill we have discovered the significance of weight and power ratio. The weight is what pulled us back but instincitively power followed suite. If either one of those were to be of advantageous to us we would've dealt with the competition with upmost artifice. Without the help of very pro Emma, this project wouldn't have been possible. With her superior perspective on arduino this was made possible.</h1>

            <h1 class="learned2 lineHeight">We are currently making a drop an egg design. The point of this project is to make a protection so the egg doesn't break. The approach we have into protecting an egg is to cover it with cotton. Then cover the cotton with tape. Finally cover it with inflated baloons then put it inside the box. after that parachute. The weak part of our design and the potential failure is the parachute or the balloon popping. If the parachoot fails the force exerted on the egg can be impacted greatly and if the balloon pops before landing it can hurt the egg significantly.</h1>
